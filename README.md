# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bj-rutledge
### ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a passionate full stack web developer. I love this stuff! 
### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on a full stack application with my partner Iconitek LLC that we hope will compete with Rover and Wag.

### I learned to code with nothing but a pencil, paper, and computer science books. I have since graduated to writing software on actual computers! I have experience in C#, Xamarian Forms, XAML, JavaScript, HTML5, Node.js, React, Python, PowerShell, BASH, and a few others. I love full stack development, but my passion is in the back end.
