# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bj-rutledge
### ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a passionate full stack web developer. I love this stuff! 

### I learned to code with nothing but a pencil, paper, and computer science books. I have since graduated to writing software on actual computers! I have experience in JavaScript, HTML5, Node.js, React, C#, XAML, Python, PowerShell, BASH, and a few others. I love full stack development, but my passion is in the back end.
